CPU Architecture Project

Overview
This repository contains a simplified CPU architecture designed for educational purposes. The design includes key components such as the **Control FSM, ALU, Register Bank, Memory, and Interconnect Bus Interface**.

## Components Breakdown

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clock & Control Signals
- Synchronizes all components
- **Inverted Clock** used for timing adjustments
- **Control FSM** manages state transitions

2Ô∏è‚É£ Instruction Register
- Holds the current instruction
- **Opcode** decoded to generate control signals

3Ô∏è‚É£ Control FSM (Finite State Machine)
- Determines next state based on **opcode**
- Controls memory access, register selection, and ALU operations

4Ô∏è‚É£ Register Bank (16 x 32-bit)
- Stores temporary data
- **RegSEL** selects register
- **RegLD** loads data into registers

5Ô∏è‚É£ Main Memory
- Connected via **Interconnection Address Bus** and **Interconnection Data Bus**
- **IBRead / IBWrite** control memory access

6Ô∏è‚É£ Interconnect Bus Interface
- Handles data transfer between memory, registers, and ALU
- **MDR (Memory Data Register)** and **MAR (Memory Address Register)** manage data transactions
- **MDRCE, MDROE, MARCE, MAROE** control input/output operations

7Ô∏è‚É£ ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Executes arithmetic and logic operations
- Uses **TEMP1** and **TEMP2** registers
- **Flags (C, V, N, Z)** indicate results

Execution Flow
1. **Fetch:** CPU retrieves instruction from memory
2. **Decode:** Control FSM interprets **opcode**
3. **Operand Fetch:** Load data from memory/registers to ALU inputs
4. **Execute:** ALU processes operation and updates flags
5. **Write Back:** Store result in register/memory

Notes üìù
- Follows **Fetch-Decode-Execute** cycle
- **Control FSM** drives all signals based on **opcode**
- **ALU Flags** used for conditional operations
- Expandable with additional instructions and features
How to Use 
1. Open the project in **Logisim/Quartus/Multisim** (or your preferred tool).
2. Run the simulation with a clock cycle.
3. Observe data flow and register updates.
